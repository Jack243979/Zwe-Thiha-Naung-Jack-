# Project Scenario — Customer Churn Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** for the Brazilian e-commerce platform **Olist**.  
Using historical purchase, delivery, and payment data, we developed a predictive model to **identify customers likely to churn** and provide actionable **business recommendations**.

---

##  Business Goal
To **reduce customer churn** and **increase retention** by predicting at-risk customers and improving **delivery, payment, and cost-related operational services**.

---

##  Objectives
1. **Predict Customer Churn**  
   - Build a machine learning model to classify customers into **churn** or **non-churn**.
2. **Identify Key Churn Drivers**  
   - Understand which features most influence churn (e.g., freight value, delivery delays).
3. **Provide Business Recommendations**  
   - Suggest operational improvements based on feature insights.
4. **Improve Customer Retention**  
   - Enable targeted campaigns and personalized offers to reduce churn rates.
